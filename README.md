- Arch User Repository (AUR) Updates

Through a simple yet beautiful interface.


> Warning: This tool is only available for Nyarch Linux users. If you are not using Nyarch Linux, you can't use this tool.


## Installation

### Windows

Why the hell do you wanna use Nyarch Updater on windows?

### Flatpak

You can install Nyarch Updater via Flatpak. It should be pre-installed from Nyarch installation. Otherwise, you can run these commands:

```bash
cd /tmp
wget https://github.com/nyarchlinux/nyarchupdater/releases/latest/download/nyarchupdater.flatpak
flatpak install nyarchupdater.flatpak
```

### Manual

You will need flatpak-builder to build Nyarch Updater. You can install it by running the following command:

```bash
sudo pacman -S flatpak-builder
```

Then, you can build Nyarch Updater by running the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NyarchLinux/NyarchUpdater.git
cd NyarchUpdater
chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
```

Nyarch Updater should now be installed on your system.

### Development

If you want to develop Nyarch Updater, you can clone the repository and start developing.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NyarchLinux/NyarchUpdater.git
cd NyarchUpdater
```

You'll need your favorite IDE and Flatpak. Open the project, and enjoy! The only way for now to run it is by running the `run.sh` script, as Gnome Builder doesn't work correctly.

## Usage

Thanks to its beautiful simple interface, you can easily update your Nyarch installation by clicking the respective Update buttons for both the release updates and the package updates.
